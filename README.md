# OwlTokenTextView

This repo provides a base template that is used to initialize all new framework projects.

##Instructions

This repo comes with a `clone.sh` script that can be used to quickly and easily set up a new framework project.

Make sure you have the `rename` command line tool installed on your machine. You can install this via Homebrew:

`brew install rename`

Once you've verified that you have `rename` installed, run the script as follows:

`./clone.sh --name OwlTest --app-name TestApp --directory ../OwlTest`

This command will create a new framework project from the template in this repo by renaming all placeholder names
with the project and sample app names that you specify. 

Once this is done, all you have to do is `cd` to the new project directory, do a `git init` and push the new repo.

Feel free to ping Brandon Lau with any questions.
